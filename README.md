# High Capacity Light-Based Neural Processor

## Abstract

This repository presents a novel architecture for neural networks based on simulated optical physics, utilizing ray tracing and holographic systems. The project, developed by Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, explores the potential of light-based computing in neural processing. By converting each neuron into a pixel, the entire neural network is represented as a dynamic image, effectively using the image itself as part of the processing mechanism.

## Introduction

Traditional neural networks rely on tensor calculations and weight adjustments. This project takes a radically different approach by simulating optical phenomena to perform neural computations. The core idea is to leverage the natural properties of light, such as intensity, tone, frequency, refraction, and backlighting, to emerge computational results without explicit calculations.

This approach is analogous to mixing yellow and blue paint to produce green. The resulting color emerges naturally from the interaction of the components, without the need for explicit color calculations. Similarly, our light-based neural processor allows computational results to emerge from the interactions of simulated light properties.

## Key Concepts

1. **Optical Physics Simulation**: The project uses ray tracing techniques to simulate the behavior of light within the neural network.
2. **Holographic Systems**: Holographic principles are employed to encode and process information within the simulated optical environment.
3. **Neural-Pixel Mapping**: Each neuron in the network is represented as a pixel in a dynamic image, creating a visual representation of the entire neural state.
4. **Emergent Computation**: Results are not explicitly calculated but emerge from the interactions of simulated optical properties.

## Implementation

The current implementation provides a web-based interface for interacting with the light-based neural processor. Key components include:

1. **WebGL Shader**: A custom WebGL shader simulates the optical physics of the neural network.
2. **Word Processing**: The system can process words, encoding them into the neural-optical state and producing output based on the emergent properties of the simulation.
3. **Visualization**: A real-time visualization of the neural-optical state is provided, offering insights into the processing mechanism.
